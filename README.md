If you have any questions about this project feel free to write me a letter to

Here is my code for MPDuino - MPD Arduino client. It allows you to control MPD
on your computer via buttons on attached Arduino board.

To compile you need:
- gcc (obviously)
- libmpd (http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/ClientLib:libmpd)
- Arduino SDK

Makefile compile only daemon code. To compile Ardiuno binary go to Arduino IDE.
